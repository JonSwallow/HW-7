     <p>A child is born in to this world. He or She grows up relatively content. <br>This person feels loved and secure, they strive for an education, and work hard.
    <br> They grow to adulthood and achieve a measure of successful living.<br> One day this person is late for work. They decide to take a short cut and get lost.
    <br>They drive for hours, though they have lived in the area all of their lives; nothing seems familiar.<br>There is a split in the road up ahead, should they turn left or right?
    <br>Choose the red button for left or the blue button for right.</p>
